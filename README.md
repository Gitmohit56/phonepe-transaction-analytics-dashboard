This project is an end-to-end Power BI dashboard built to analyze large-scale PhonePe digital payment transaction data. The objective was to transform raw fintech data into meaningful business insights using data cleaning, modeling, and visualization techniques.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of transaction performance, including total transaction amount (in Millions & Billions), total transaction count, and success vs failure rates (with ~96% successful transactions observed). It also analyzes key failure reasons such as server errors, wrong PIN entries, bank denials, insufficient balance, and incorrect information.

In addition, the project includes service-wise performance insights across categories like Insurance, Loans, Money Transfer, and Recharge & Bill Payments. Monthly and date-wise transaction trends were analyzed to identify growth patterns and performance fluctuations over time.

Interactive filters allow users to dynamically explore the data by date, service category, and payment status, making the dashboard both analytical and user-friendly.
